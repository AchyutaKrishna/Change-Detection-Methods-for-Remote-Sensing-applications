# Change-Detection-Methods-for-Remote-Sensing-applications

**Abstract**

Change detection is one of the most popular fields in remote sensing. It has a lot of applications in various fields including urban management, forest management, disaster recovery etc. A lot of techniques have been developed over the years to perform the task of change detection. With the advent of deep learning, many deep learning based change detection techniques have been coming up. In this project, we have applied two such deep learning techniques for change detection, namely the Deep Change Vector Analysis and the Deep Slow Feature Analysis. These techniques were tested on two existing datasets to do a comparative study. Furthermore, datasets were obtained from regions in India and change maps Produced for those datasets. The aim is to apply the above deep learning models to the obtained datasets to try to get invaluable results which can be analyzed for useful purposes.
